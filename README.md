Network_Project4
================
This program uses the linux socket library to create, bind, listen, and accept tcp connections.
To use the tcp_test.cpp on a neighbor machine to send data to the program, compile and run with an IP 
address destination.

The program will output the data received from the tcp transmission and then close the connection
and then wait for further transmissions.
